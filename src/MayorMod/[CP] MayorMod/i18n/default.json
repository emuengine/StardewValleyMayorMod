	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingSaloonHours_1": "I would like to apply for extended opening hours. If the saloon is open earlier I plan to do a breakfast and brunch menu. I also think that if we stay open later it will be good for the economy and bring some nightlife to the village.",

	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingTownSecurity_1": "For the past while there have been incidents of monsters sneaking out of the mines at night. Most of the time this just results in anybody foolish enough to be out past 2am having belongings stolen by the more sneaky monsters. I am worried though that the nastier ones will really hurt someone one of these days.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingTownSecurity_2": "I've seen no statistical rise in incidents.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingTownSecurity_3": "I don't know. They sounds scary. They could be dangerous if left unchecked.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingTownSecurity_4": "Nobody has been hurt though. This could be expensive to have more security.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingTownSecurity_5": "I think even just a guards on the entrance would help considerably. They could then rase the alarm.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingTownSecurity_6Q": "What do you think?",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingTownSecurity_6A0": "I think more security for the town would be good. We should hire some security.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingTownSecurity_6A1": "I don't think this is a big issue. Let's do nothing for now and see.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingTownSecurity_7": "Excellent! I'll look after ASAP. We will have a guard posted by the mine every night.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingNoSecurity_0": "This is very disappointing. I suppose the Adventure Guild can keep an eye out for the moment.",

	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingCleanup_0": "Hello everyone. Today's agenda is to discuss what to do about the rubbish problem in the town.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingCleanup_1": "I am of the opinion that we need to hire a cleaning crew, our town looks terrible with all these littered streets.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingCleanup_2": "I'm with Marlon on this. It is about time we took care of this problem. A clean town benefits everyone.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingCleanup_3": "But at what cost? We can't just throw money at every problem. People should take care of their own trash.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingCleanup_4": "Hmm certain people might think they don't need to dispose of their waste properly themselves.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingCleanup_5": "That's exactly why I think it's worth the investment. It will set a good example for residents and keeps our town looking nice.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingCleanup_6": "And think about all the businesses that could benefit from a cleaner environment. It would be an attractive feature for potential customers.",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingCleanup_7Q": "What do you think?",
	"EmuEngine.MayorModCP_Events.CouncilMeetingCleanup_7A0": "I think we should hire a cleaning crew for the town.",
