### Run for election
Register as a candidate and campaign across the valley. Build support by talking to villagers and showing your dedication to the town. The election outcome depends on your relationships and actions leading up to the vote.

### Debate
Join a live debate with Mayor Lewis. Answer questions, present your vision, and persuade the townspeople why you're the better choice for mayor. Your performance can influence the election results.

### Town Hall
Lewis has been using the old Town Hall as his personal space for years. Once you're elected, you'll reclaim it as a functional government building and center for town planning and decision-making.

### Council meetings
Host and lead council meetings where you and other council members discuss and vote on town improvements. Make choices that affect Pelican Town's development and daily life.
